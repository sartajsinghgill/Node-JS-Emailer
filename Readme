# Node JS Emailer

This is a emailer program that can be run via nodeJS. All configuration is to be added to a config.json file.

## Installation

Run the following command to install the required node modules (nodemailer). 

```bash
npm install
```
Create a config.json file and add the following parameters.

```bash
touch config.js
``` 

Config.js file should have the following parameters

```json
{
    "email_service": "",
    "send_email_username": "",
    "send_email_password": "",
    "to_email": "",
    "email_interval": ,
    "userlist_filename": "",
    "userlist_file_encoding": ""
}
```

Create a csv file and name it as you define in the config.json file. The program expects a csv file with 1 column, no headers and anything you put in each row will be sent to the email address.

## Usage

node run start
```
